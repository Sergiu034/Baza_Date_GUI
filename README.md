# GUI Project

## Introduction

This JavaFX application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting
with the delivery management database. It facilitates the execution of predefined
queries, allowing users to view and manage information related to suppliers,
components, projects, and deliveries. The application simplifies database
interactions, making it accessible for users without SQL expertise.

## Features

• Interactive GUI: A user-friendly interface for database operations.

• Predefined Queries: Execute specific queries with the click of a button,
  including viewing suppliers by status, components by weight, matching
  projects and components by city, and more.

• Dynamic Results Display: Query results are displayed directly in the
  application's interface, with the ability to toggle between views and
  operations.

## Technologies Used

• JavaFX: For creating the GUI.

• JDBC: For database connectivity.
